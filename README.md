# seekingsteiner
Finds string (your time-lost lovers) in number-chaos.
~~Does not work yet, probably doesn't even compile.~~
Now it does work! W00t!!!

# HOW-TO

`$ make` to compile

`$ seekingsteiner name1 name2 name3 ...` to seek each argument in turn

`$ seekingsteiner < somefile` to seek each line in the file in turn

# BUGS

~~Can't find unicode strings yet.~~
Now it can. It'll work on most strings since all operations on strings are done as if it were random bytes.
Don't input a string with any control ASCII, though. ;)

# TO DO

You tell me!
